1. Conceptual Nuance & Semantic Understanding:
These questions try to get at the core meaning or subtle differences, forcing the model to go beyond keyword matching.

"Explain how data confidentiality is maintained by proper crypto usage." (Tests A02: Cryptographic Failures – focuses on 'confidentiality' beyond just 'encryption')
"What's the difference between authentication and authorization from a security perspective?" (Tests A07: Identification and Authentication Failures vs A01: Broken Access Control - fundamental distinction)
"Can insecure design alone lead to system compromise without coding errors?" (Tests A04: Insecure Design – emphasizes 'design' over 'implementation flaws')
"Beyond patching, what's a proactive way to manage vulnerable dependencies?" (Tests A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components – looks for proactive rather than reactive solutions)

2. Cross-Category Linkage & Proactive Suggestions:
These aim to trigger related topics or see if the model can implicitly link concepts across different OWASP categories.

"A weak password policy leads to what kind of OWASP Top 10 issue, and what might happen next?" (Tests A07 but probes for downstream impact/related issues like A01)
"If an attacker can access sensitive internal API endpoints, which OWASP risk is that, and what other risks should I consider?" (Tests A10: SSRF but also implicitly A01 and A05, looking for proactive suggestions)
"I'm worried about sensitive data appearing in logs. What OWASP category covers that, and how does it relate to data exposure?" (Tests A09: Security Logging and its connection to A02 or A05)
"How does a lack of secure CI/CD practices contribute to data integrity issues?" (Tests A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures and its connection to development practices)

3. Solution/Mitigation-Oriented (Complex):
These questions ask for solutions, which might map to prevention sections.

"What architectural patterns help mitigate insecure design choices early in development?" (Tests A04: Insecure Design – looking for design-level solutions)
"I want to protect my application from command injection. What are the best practices?" (Tests A03: Injection – requires finding comprehensive prevention)
"How do I ensure my web application's identity verification process is robust against common attacks?" (Tests A07: Identification and Authentication Failures – looking for robust solutions)

4. Indirect or Abstract Queries:
These use less direct terminology to see if the semantic understanding holds up.

"My app's error messages are too verbose. Which OWASP risk is that, and why is it a problem?" (Tests A05: Security Misconfiguration or A09: Logging – probes for information leakage)
"What are the dangers of fetching external resources via user-supplied URLs without careful validation?" (Tests A10: SSRF without explicitly saying "SSRF")
"If my system's internal configuration files are accessible through a web browser, what vulnerability applies?" (Tests A05: Security Misconfiguration related to exposed files)

5. Combination / Scenario-Based:
Asking about a scenario that touches multiple areas.

"An attacker found an exposed admin panel, and then guessed the default password. Which OWASP categories are involved, and what's the combined impact?" (Tests A01: Broken Access Control and A07: Authentication Failures, looking for multi-faceted understanding)
