This section outlines the techniques and policies that can be implemented to bolster browser security. While this focuses on traditional web browsers, developers should verify client-side security features of other clients (mobile apps, API clients, smart-TVs) and configure respective HTTP headers accordingly. Browser security directives are opportunistic and depend on browser support, which varies over time and across versions. Explicitly setting security headers can unify browser behavior and reduce maintenance effort. A fully compromised browser may ignore these, but at that stage attackers have other severe exploits.",
